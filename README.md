# SVG-Animation
## Overview
This is practice creating an SVG file using Figma and animating it using primarily CSS and some Javascrip. 
## Issues
Currently, the word does animate properly. Three of the letters will not fill out, I assume I have the wrong pixel measurement but have not been able to confirm that.
